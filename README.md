Overview
--------

The barbican module is a part of [OpenStack](https://opendev.org/openstack), an effort by the OpenStack infrastructure team to provide continuous integration testing and code review for OpenStack and OpenStack community projects not part of the core software.  The module itself is used to flexibly configure and manage the Key management service for OpenStack.

Module Description
------------------

The barbican module is a thorough attempt to make Puppet capable of managing the entirety of barbican.  This includes manifests to provision region specific endpoint and database connections.  Types are shipped as part of the barbican module to assist in manipulation of configuration files.

Setup
-----

**What the barbican module affects**

* [Barbican](https://docs.openstack.org/barbican/latest/), the Key management service for OpenStack.

### Installing barbican

barbican is not currently in Puppet Forge, but is anticipated to be added soon.  Once that happens, you'll be able to install barbican with:

```
puppet module install openstack/barbican
```

### Beginning with barbican

To utilize the barbican module's functionality you will need to declare multiple resources.  The following is a modified excerpt from the [openstack module](https://github.com/openstack/puppet-openstack).  This is not an exhaustive list of all the components needed, we recommend you consult and understand the [openstack module](https://github.com/openstack/puppet-openstack) and the [core openstack](http://docs.openstack.org) documentation.

Implementation
--------------

### barbican

barbican is a combination of Puppet manifest and ruby code to delivery configuration and extra functionality through types and providers.

Limitations
-----------

* All the barbican types use the CLI tools and so need to be ran on the barbican node.

Development
